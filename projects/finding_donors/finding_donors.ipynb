    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **  \n",
    "#### Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression can be used in situations where we want to predict in which of two categories someone is most probable to belong. As an example, we can use it to classify voters in two parties and predict the result of the vote.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths:  \n",
    "* Dependent variables don't have to be normally distributed,\n",
    "* Independent variables can be categorical variable and bounded\n",
    "* Can work on both linear and non-linear relationship between the input and output variables,\n",
    "* Can be updated easily with new data using stochastic gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses: \n",
    "* Requires large sample size to achieve stable results,\n",
    "* Performance decreases if the function has too many non-linear relationships,\n",
    "* Not adaptable to more complex situations,\n",
    "* Not flexible enough to naturally capture more complex relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset has a lot of categorical variables which Logistic regression handles easily. Additionally, it is simple and fast algorithm so most of the time worth give it a try. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Support Vector Machines  \n",
    "\n",
    "SVMs are helpful in text and hypertext categorization as their application can significantly reduce the need for labeled training instances in both the standard inductive and transductive settings.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths:  \n",
    "* Effective in high dimensional spaces.  \n",
    "* Still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.  \n",
    "* Uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient.  \n",
    "* Versatile: different [Kernel functions](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#svm-kernels) can be specified for the decision function. Common kernels are provided, but it is also possible to specify custom kernels.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses:  \n",
    "* If the number of features is much greater than the number of samples, avoid over-fitting in choosing [Kernel functions](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#svm-kernels) and regularization term is crucial.  \n",
    "* SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates, these are calculated using an expensive five-fold cross-validation.  \n",
    "(Source: [Scikit Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#classification))  \n",
    "\n",
    "After the pre-processing of the dataset we ended up with a 103 features. The effectiveness of SVMs in high dimensional spaces seems appropriate for the problem.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gradient Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient boosting can be used in the field of learning to rank. The commercial web search engines Yahoo and Yandex  use variants of gradient boosting in their machine-learned ranking engines. (source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting#Usage)).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths:\n",
    "* Natural handling of data of mixed type (= heterogeneous features)\n",
    "* Predictive power\n",
    "* Robustness to outliers in output space (via robust loss functions)  \n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses:\n",
    "* Scalability, due to the sequential nature of boosting it can hardly be parallelized.  \n",
    "(Source: [Scikit Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#gradient-tree-boosting))  \n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosting is one of the most powerful algorithms and our dataset's size allow us to use it in a reasonable time."

    "Imagine  20 teams (trees) of 5 members each (explanatory variables). A boss at the top, then subordinates, then more subordinates, and so on. We give them a book to read, and they have to answer 20 questions (Number of observations in our data). Assume they have binary answers: Yes or No.  Now, we start the process. The process aims to maximize the correct answers by building 20 teams of 5 members each. Any member can be a  part of more than one team, and any member can have more than 1 role on the same team. The member who has the maximum number of roles is the most important variable of our model.\n",

    "The process starts with a random guess of answers. These answers will create an error  ( = Actual - Predicted Answer). Next step, we build a team of 5  members, which reduces the error by the most it can. Again, we calculate the error. The second team (tree) has to reduce it further, but it doesn't trust its previous partner entirely, so it assumes that the answers are correct with x probability (learning rate). This process goes on until 20  teams are built. So in the process, we have to decide, how many teams to build (trees), the members of each team(depth) and learning team, so that the error, in the end, is minimum. This can only be done by trial and error method.\n",

Thus \"education_level\" is correlated with \"education-num\" and \"relationship\" is correlated with \"marital-status\" so they don't have anything more to offer to the model."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
